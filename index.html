        <h1>Hello, Iâ€™m Liya Thomas</h1>
        <h2>Cyber Security Graduate | Business Analyst | Web Developer | Open to New Tech Opportunities</h2>
        <p>
            I am a Cyber Security graduate from Deakin University, currently enhancing my skills through the Professional Year program at ECA.
            With a passion for digital security, I aim to help businesses safeguard their assets and build resilient infrastructures in a rapidly changing threat landscape.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have deep expertise in threat analysis, vulnerability assessment, and red team operations. Over the years, I have gained extensive experience 
            working on cybersecurity challenges and successfully identifying risks, responding to incidents, and proactively implementing solutions to protect against 
            evolving cyber threats. I believe in the power of collaboration and continuous learning, which enables me to adapt and excel in addressing diverse security challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
            My previous roles include leading a team of web developers, conducting market research for cybersecurity companies, and leading red team operations for threat assessments. I have honed my problem-solving skills, as well as my ability to communicate and collaborate effectively with technical and non-technical teams. I am always excited to face new challenges and contribute to the security and growth of an organization.
